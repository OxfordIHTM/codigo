The [International Classification of Diseases (ICD)](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases) serves a broad range of uses globally and provides critical knowledge on the extent, causes and consequences of human disease and death worldwide via data that is reported and coded with the ICD. [ICD API](https://icd.who.int/icdapi) allows programmatic access to the ICD. It is an HTTP based REST API. This package provides functions that interface with the ICD API.

## What does `codigo` do?

Please note that `codigo` is still experimental but is nearing a stable release. It is possible that some functionalities described below and in the rest of the package documentation may change interface or approach but these changes will likely be minor.

Currently, the package provides functions for:

* Authenticating with the ICD API (*stable*);
* Performing a search of ICD-11 foundation and linearization components (*stable*);
* Performing autocoding of causes of death using the ICD-11 foundation and linearization components (*stable*);
* Getting information on various ICD-11 foundation and linearization entities (*experimental*);
* Converting ICD-10 codes to ICD-11 codes and vice versa (*stable*); and,
* Determining the underlying cause of death based on reported information on a death certificate (*experimental*).

## Installation

`codigo` is not yet on CRAN but can be installed from the [Oxford IHTM R-universe](https://oxfordihtm.r-universe.dev) as follows:

```{r install-r-universe, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(
  "codigo",
  repos = c('https://oxfordihtm.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```

and then can be loaded into an R session

```{r load-package, eval = TRUE}
# load package
library(codigo)
```

## Usage

### Authenticating with the ICD API

The ICD API uses OAuth2 for authentication. The package has a set of utility functions that support the ICD API authentication specifications leading to the generation of an OAuth2 token. The `icd_oauth_client()` function is the downstream and user-facing function that creates an ICD OAuth2 client that can be used for token retrieval by future functions that wrap ICD API for entity and linearization information retrieval.

An ICD OAuth2 client can be generated as follows:

```R
icd_oauth_client()
```

This function uses a built in OAuth2 client created for light use and for purposes of package development and testing.

It is recommended that those intending to use this package for programmatically performing high volume of calls to the ICD API to create their own **access keys** (`client id` and `client secret`) using [these instructions](https://icd.who.int/docs/icd-api/API-Authentication/).

Then, with your access keys, perform the following commands:

```R
## Create your own OAuth client ----
my_oauth_client <- icd_oauth_client(
  id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  token_url = "https://icdaccessmanagement.who.int/connect/token",
  secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  name = "NAME_OF_YOUR_APP"
)
```

This OAuth2 client can now be used to the various functions in the package that require an OAuth2 client for authentication for making requests to the ICD API.

### Performing a basic search

The main feature of the ICD API is the ability to search ICD 11 Foundation and ICD 11 Linearization for information regarding an illness/disease. This feature is captured by the `icd_search` functions. For example, if *colorectal cancer* is the disease of interest and information available from ICD 11 is needed, the following call can be made:

```{r search, eval = FALSE}
icd_search("colorectal cancer", client = my_oauth_client)
```

which gives the following output:

```{r result, echo = FALSE}
icd_search("colorectal cancer")
```

The output is a tibble created from parsed JSON body text of the HTTP response from the ICD API.

## Citation

If you find the `codigo` package useful please cite using the suggested citation provided by a call to the `citation()` function as follows:

```{r citation}
citation("codigo")
```
