The [International Classification of Diseases
(ICD)](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases)
serves a broad range of uses globally and provides critical knowledge on
the extent, causes and consequences of human disease and death worldwide
via data that is reported and coded with the ICD. [ICD
API](https://icd.who.int/icdapi) allows programmatic access to the ICD.
It is an HTTP based REST API. This package provides functions that
interface with the ICD API.
